BUGS:


FEATURES
- DIIS: https://www.chem.fsu.edu/~deprince/programming_projects/diis/
http://vergil.chemistry.gatech.edu/notes/diis/node1.html

- Write tests for package
- Add dashed line below occupied orbitals in MO energy output
- Finish F,P,C matrix writing for UHF per iteration and cleanup in general
- Implement Fock using sparse version of 2ERI from GaussianBasis.jl
- Better guess than Hcore. PModel or Patom? Whatever is easier
- Support broken-symmetry wavefunction
- Dipole moment
- Add colors as optional in output
- electric field gradient
